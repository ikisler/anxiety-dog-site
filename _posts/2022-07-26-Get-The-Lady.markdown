In the (probably) last in our series where Mister Billy and Mister Q stayed home while I was travelling, Mr. Q had the frustrating task of trying to get the dog to go anywhere. All Billy wanted to do was stay home until my return. He knows what it means to "go get the Lady", and was finally happy to jump in the car to pick me up.

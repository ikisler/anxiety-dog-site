transcript: "Billy the dog has exciting dreams which involve open eyes and twitching everything."
---

Billy doesn't normally dream with his eyes open. Often there are twitchy toes or little woofs. Occasionally you get a tail wag or a tiny mournful howl (the saddest! D: ). Sometimes he lays there with his eyes open, so you don't realize he's sleeping (so weird).   And sometimes, everything goes on at once...

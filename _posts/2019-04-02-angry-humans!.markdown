The Clockwork Alchemy convention had a light saber tournament this year! Billy and I went to go watch for a bit, and I learned that Billy is super uncomfortable when people hit each other with sticks (who knew?). We lasted about five minutes before I had to accept that Billy is too sensitive to settle down (also we were blocking the walkway with the leash). Ah well.

transcript: "In which Kage the dog cool aid's our screen door, Oh Yeah!"
---

With special guest star Kage (Kha-Gay), AKA Kage the Cool Aid Dog. 
  
We were watching Kage for the weekend, and decided to separate Kage and Billy while they ate - mostly because they kept trying to eat the other dog's food. We put Kage outside, closed the screen door, and filled the dog dishes. We heard a weird noise, turned around, and saw Kage looking at us with his nose through the screen. It seems he didn't notice the screen and decided to run for dinner.  
We all spent a moment regarding each other before he removed his nose from the screen and patiently stood and waited for his dinner, not with his nose in a door, instead.

This happens a lot. These are only a couple examples. Other things he has hit with his tail include chairs, his dog bed, people, plastic bags (the most dangerous of all), and himself (once, as far as we know).   We've gotten to the point where he will return and see what it was he hit instead of completely running away. Progress!

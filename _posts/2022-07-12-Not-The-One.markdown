Mister Billy and Mister Q stayed home while I was travelling. Billy was not terribly happy about the whole thing, and even more unhappy when Mr. Q had to leave him behind for a day (more on that later). My brother in law has the same car that we do, and Billy knows what it sounds like. He got excited and then sad :(
<br> (on a completely separate occation, Billy once jumped into a strange man's Audi because he thought it was my car)

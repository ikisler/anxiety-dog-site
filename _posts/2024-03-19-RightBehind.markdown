Annabelle is very very interested in Billy eating his kibbles.

This is the "pencils" version of this comic. This is as far as I've made it this week, but Mr. Q convinced me to go ahead and post it anyway. 
Normally a comic would have "final ink" (quotations because it's all digital) and colors. This might be what the comic looks like for a little bit while I have crazy work time.

Billy's friend Radar is no longer with us. Radar lived a good long time, and was a sweet happy (though sometimes demanding) pupper to the end. He was one of Billy's first friends.  Radar did have certain insecurities - different, and much smaller in magnitude than Billy's. They got on really well, and Billy liked to follow him around.  I'm going to run some comics detailing their adventures.

When I posted the "Two Speeds" comic, Mr. Q's first response was, "That's not how he walks with me."  Billy is far more morose (to put it mildly) if I am not on a walk with him. This happens to the point where Mr. Q gets excited whenever Billy does normal things like sniffing a bush.   For narrative purposes, we refer to me as "The Lady" in the dog's view. I'm not completely sure how this started.
